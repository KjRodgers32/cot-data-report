# Why COT Data
I've had an interest in trading since my junior year in college and I've always thought the Foriegn Exchange Market was the most intersing.
A few months back, my brother and cousin also started messing around that trying their luck at trading as well. So I figured I would put
together a website that could help them kinda of understand and dabble init. The first of my ideas was just to find a way to easily show
them some free data, that is released every week, that could help them understand why some currencies move in a certain way. This reports
aer traditionally hard to read and come out in a horrible format, which can be pretty jarring for a beginner to read and understand. This
website makes it much easier to follow.
